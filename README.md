# My Personal Website

This is my first ((nearly) completed) crack at building a personal website. This is a frontend React project built using Vite. 


## **Tools**
I wanted to challenge myself to use some tools I have never used before (with the exception of React). Here's a breakdown of the tools used in this project:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development Tool
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - React Component Library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/) - React Animation Library
